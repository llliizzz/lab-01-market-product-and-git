## Job market snapshot

### Skills that appear in several postings

- Manual testing (functional, regression)  
- Writing test documentation / bug reports  
- Web testing  
- Basic API testing  
- Jira (или аналогичная система для баг-трекинга)

### Skills specific to a single posting

- Mobile testing (iOS/Android) — только в Mobile QA  
- Test automation (Selenium, Python/Java) — только в автоматизации  
- CI/CD familiarity — только в автоматизированной вакансии  
- Basic SQL — явлено только в Junior QA Manual

## Personal reflection

I chose the role of QA Engineer because I like finding bugs and help make products better and more reliable for users.  
Also I feel that this role lets me understand how software works without writing too much complicated code.  

Right now my skills match the market only on basic level: I understand manual testing, Git and simple APIs, which many junior QA jobs require.  
But compared to the market, I am still behind with test automation and professional testing tools.  

I noticed that many companies expect QA engineers to know both manual and automated testing, what I don’t fully have yet.  

This semester I want to develop two main skills: test automation and SQL.  
Learning automation (for example Selenium or Playwright) will help me to be more competitive and apply for better QA jobs.  
Improving my SQL skills will let me analyze data, check databases and test backend systems more effective.  

Overall, this analysis helped me better understand what employers really expect from QA engineers and what I need to focus on next.
